## 1. Introduction

Pediatric neurology encompasses disorders of the nervous system in children, from neonates to adolescents. The developing brain presents unique challenges and opportunities for diagnosis and treatment. This lecture provides a systematic approach to understanding seizures and epilepsy in the pediatric population, with emphasis on the modern genetic era and precision medicine.

### Why This Matters

- **Prevalence**: Epilepsy affects approximately 0.5-1% of children worldwide
- **Impact**: Seizures can significantly affect neurodevelopment and quality of life
- **Opportunity**: Early accurate diagnosis enables targeted therapy and improved outcomes

---

## 2. Seizure Fundamentals

### 2.1 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Seizure** | A transient occurrence of signs/symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain |
| **Epilepsy** | A disease characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures (≥2 unprovoked seizures >24h apart, or 1 seizure with high recurrence risk ≥60%) |
| **Status Epilepticus** | A seizure lasting >5 minutes, or multiple seizures without full recovery between them |

### 2.2 Seizure Semiology

Understanding seizure onset and evolution is critical for:
- **Localization**: Identifying the epileptogenic zone
- **Classification**: Determining seizure type
- **Treatment Selection**: Guiding appropriate medication choice
- **Surgical Planning**: When applicable

### 2.3 Key Questions for Seizure History

```
□ What was the patient doing before the seizure?
□ Was there any warning (aura)?
□ Where did the movements start? (focal vs. generalized onset)
□ What was the sequence of events?
□ Was there loss of awareness?
□ How long did each phase last?
□ What was the postictal state?
□ Were there any triggers? (fever, sleep deprivation, photic)
```

---

## 3. ILAE Classification of Epilepsy

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) provides the standardized framework for epilepsy classification.

### 3.1 Three Levels of Diagnosis (2017 Framework)

```
Level 1: SEIZURE TYPE
    ↓
Level 2: EPILEPSY TYPE
    ↓
Level 3: EPILEPSY SYNDROME
```

### 3.2 Updated Seizure Classification (2025)

The [ILAE updated classification](https://www.ilae.org/guidelines/guidelines-and-reports/updated-classification-of-epileptic-seizures-position-paper-of-the-international-league-against-epilepsy) maintains four main classes:

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Focal** | Originates in networks limited to one hemisphere |
| **Generalized** | Originates at some point within, and rapidly engaging, bilateral networks |
| **Unknown** | Cannot be determined whether focal or generalized |
| **Unclassified** | Inadequate information or unusual features |

#### Focal Seizures - Key Classifiers

- **Awareness**: Retained vs. Impaired
- **Motor onset**: Automatisms, atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, hyperkinetic, myoclonic, tonic
- **Non-motor onset**: Autonomic, behavior arrest, cognitive, emotional, sensory

#### Generalized Seizures

- **Motor**: Tonic-clonic, clonic, tonic, myoclonic, atonic, epileptic spasms
- **Non-motor (Absence)**: Typical, atypical, myoclonic, eyelid myoclonia

### 3.3 Epilepsy Syndromes (2022 ILAE Classification)

The [2022 ILAE position papers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.17241) established consensus criteria for epilepsy syndromes:

#### Syndromes by Age of Onset

**Neonates and Infants (0-2 years)**
- Self-limited neonatal epilepsy
- Self-limited familial neonatal epilepsy
- Early infantile DEE (e.g., Ohtahara syndrome)
- Epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures
- Infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (West syndrome)
- Dravet syndrome

**Childhood**
- *Self-limited focal epilepsies:*
  - Self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SLECTS/Rolandic)
  - Self-limited epilepsy with autonomic seizures (Panayiotopoulos)
  - Childhood occipital visual epilepsy
  - Photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy

- *Generalized epilepsies:*
  - Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE)
  - Epilepsy with myoclonic absences
  - Epilepsy with eyelid myoclonia (Jeavons syndrome)

- *Developmental and/or Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEE):*
  - Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
  - Epileptic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep

---

## 4. Electroencephalography (EEG)

### 4.1 Role of EEG in Pediatric Epilepsy

EEG is essential for:
- Confirming epileptic nature of events
- Classifying seizure/epilepsy type
- Identifying epilepsy syndrome
- Localizing epileptogenic zone
- Monitoring treatment response

### 4.2 Age-Dependent Normal EEG Patterns

Understanding normal EEG maturation is critical for accurate interpretation. The [NCBI developmental EEG resource](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK390356/) provides comprehensive guidance.

#### Posterior Dominant Rhythm (PDR) Development

| Age | PDR Frequency | Key Features |
|-----|---------------|--------------|
| Newborn | No PDR | Discontinuous, trace alternant in sleep |
| 3 months | 3-4 Hz | Emerging rhythmicity |
| 6 months | 4-5 Hz | PDR established |
| 12 months | 5-6 Hz | Increasing organization |
| 2 years | 6-7 Hz | Better defined PDR |
| 3 years | 7-8 Hz | Approaching alpha range |
| 8-9 years | 8-9 Hz | Near-adult frequencies |
| 10-12 years | 9-10 Hz | Adult-like pattern |

#### Age Group Classifications

| Age Group | Age Range | EEG Characteristics |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Neonate | 0-1 month | Rapid changes every 2 weeks in preterm |
| Infant | 1-12 months | Changes monthly |
| Toddler | 1-3 years | Changes yearly |
| Preschool | 3-6 years | Gradual maturation |
| School-age | 6-12 years | Approaches adult pattern |
| Adolescent | 13-18 years | Adult-like, 10 Hz alpha |

### 4.3 Normal Variants (Not to be Misinterpreted as Abnormal)

| Pattern | Description | Clinical Significance |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Posterior slow waves of youth** | Intermixed delta in posterior regions | Normal until age 12 |
| **Mu rhythm** | Central arciform 8-10 Hz | Blocked by movement/thought |
| **Lambda waves** | Posterior sharp transients | Present with visual scanning |
| **Hypnagogic hypersynchrony** | High-amplitude theta in drowsiness | Normal in children |
| **Vertex waves** | Sharp transients at Cz in sleep | Normal Stage N2 |

### 4.4 Pathological EEG Patterns

#### Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs)

| Pattern | Associated Syndrome |
|---------|---------------------|
| Centrotemporal spikes | Self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes |
| 3 Hz spike-wave | Childhood absence epilepsy |
| Hypsarrhythmia | Infantile spasms (West syndrome) |
| Slow spike-wave (<2.5 Hz) | Lennox-Gastaut syndrome |
| Generalized polyspike-wave | Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy |
| Focal spikes/sharp waves | Focal epilepsy |

## 5. Seizures in the Genetic Era

### 5.1 The Genetic Architecture of Epilepsy

Approximately **40% of epilepsies** have a significant genetic component. The landmark paper by [Manolio et al. (Nature, 2009)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08494) introduced the concept of "missing heritability."

#### Types of Genetic Variants

| Type | Frequency | Effect Size | Detection Method |
|------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Common variants | >1% in population | Small | GWAS |
| Rare variants | <1% in population | Large | Sequencing |
| De novo mutations | Unique to individual | Variable | Trio WES/WGS |
| Copy number variants | Variable | Variable | Microarray, WGS |

### 5.2 Major Epilepsy Genes

The following genes are most frequently implicated in genetic epilepsies:

#### Ion Channel Genes

| Gene | Channel | Phenotype | Inheritance |
|------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **SCN1A** | Nav1.1 | Dravet syndrome, GEFS+ | AD (often de novo) |
| **SCN2A** | Nav1.2 | Early infantile DEE, BFNIS | AD |
| **SCN8A** | Nav1.6 | Early infantile DEE | AD (de novo) |
| **KCNQ2** | Kv7.2 | BFNE, KCNQ2-DEE | AD |
| **KCNT1** | KNa1.1 | EIMFS, ADNFLE | AD |

#### Synaptic Function Genes

| Gene | Function | Phenotype |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **STXBP1** | Synaptic vesicle release | Ohtahara, West syndrome, DEE |
| **SYNGAP1** | Synaptic plasticity | ID with epilepsy |
| **CDKL5** | Kinase signaling | CDKL5-DEE, atypical Rett |
| **PCDH19** | Cell adhesion | PCDH19-clustering epilepsy (females) |

#### Gene Prevalence (per live births)

Based on recent epidemiological data:
- **PRRT2**: 1 per 9,970
- **SCN1A**: 1 per 12,200
- **KCNQ2**: 1 per 17,000
- **SLC2A1**: 1 per 24,300

### 5.3 Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEEs)

DEEs are severe conditions where both the underlying etiology and epileptic activity contribute to developmental impairment. [Over 800 genes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352464224001962) have been implicated in DEEs.

#### Key DEE Genes and Clinical Features

| Gene | Key Features | Treatment Considerations |
|------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **SCN1A** | Fever-triggered seizures, myoclonic jerks | AVOID sodium channel blockers |
| **KCNQ2** | Neonatal onset, tonic seizures | Sodium channel blockers EFFECTIVE |
| **STXBP1** | Variable phenotype, movement disorders | Levetiracetam may help |
| **CDKL5** | Early onset, stereotypies (~79%) | Limited ASM efficacy |

## 8. Precision Medicine in Epilepsy

### 8.1 The Promise of Precision Therapy

Precision medicine aims to match treatment to the underlying molecular mechanism. Reference: [PMC article on precision medicine in epilepsy](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9561034/)

### 8.2 Gene-Specific Treatment Strategies

#### SCN1A (Dravet Syndrome) - Critical Safety Information

**⚠️ MEDICATIONS TO AVOID:**

| Drug Class | Specific Drugs | Reason |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| Sodium channel blockers | Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Oxcarbazepine, Lamotrigine, Lacosamide, Rufinamide | Worsen seizures and status epilepticus |
| GABA modulators | Vigabatrin, Tiagabine | May worsen seizures |

Reference: [Dravet Syndrome Foundation - Medications to Avoid](https://dravetsyndromenews.com/medications-to-avoid-dravet-syndrome/)

**✓ RECOMMENDED TREATMENTS:**

1. **First-line**: Valproate + Clobazam
2. **Add-on**: Stiripentol, Cannabidiol, Fenfluramine
3. **Rescue**: Benzodiazepines (NOT phenytoin/fosphenytoin)

#### KCNQ2-Related Epilepsy

Based on the [KCNQ2 paradigm for precision medicine](https://jtggjournal.com/article/view/3566):

| Variant Type | Mechanism | Treatment |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Loss of function (LOF) | Reduced channel activity | Sodium channel blockers EFFECTIVE |
| Gain of function (GOF) | Increased channel activity | Sodium channel blockers optimal |

**First-line**: Carbamazepine, Oxcarbazepine, Phenytoin

#### STXBP1-DEE

- **Levetiracetam**: Good response in 6/8 patients
- **Vigabatrin**: Effective for epileptic spasms (4/5 patients)

### 8.3 Emerging Therapies

| Approach | Target | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) | SCN1A (Dravet) | Clinical trials |
| Gene therapy (ETX101) | SCN1A | Clinical trials |
| CRISPR/dCas9 | SCN1A upregulation | Preclinical |
| Ezogabine/Retigabine | KCNQ2 | Compassionate use |

---

## 9. Clinical Pearls and Pitfalls

### 9.1 Diagnostic Pearls

| Pearl | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| "Fever + prolonged seizure in infant = think SCN1A" | Early genetic testing in suspected Dravet |
| "Neonatal seizures with burst suppression = think STXBP1, KCNQ2" | Guide urgent genetic testing |
| "Seizures only in females with variable severity = think PCDH19" | X-linked pattern |
| "Glucose low in CSF with normal blood glucose = think GLUT1" | SLC2A1 testing, ketogenic diet |

### 9.2 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Starting sodium channel blocker without genetic diagnosis | Worsening in Dravet syndrome | Consider genetic testing early |
| Misinterpreting normal EEG variants as epileptiform | Overdiagnosis, unnecessary treatment | Know age-appropriate patterns |
| Skipping developmental history | Missing DEE diagnosis | Always assess milestones |
| Ignoring family history | Missing inherited syndromes | Three-generation pedigree |

### 9.3 Emergency Considerations

**For patients with known Dravet syndrome or suspected SCN1A mutation:**

```
⚠️ IN STATUS EPILEPTICUS:
✓ USE: Benzodiazepines (lorazepam, diazepam, midazolam)
✓ USE: Valproate IV
✗ AVOID: Phenytoin/Fosphenytoin
✗ AVOID: Lacosamide
```
